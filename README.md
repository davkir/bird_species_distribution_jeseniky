Analysis and visualization of 4 bird species distribution in Jeseníky natural protected area in relation to elevation

Repository contains a Jupyter notebook with workflow for data processing and visualization of distribution of 4 bird species in Jeseníky natural protected area in relation to elevation zones. Moreover, elevation data in the form of contour lines, file with delimitation of the area and csv files with bird observation data are provided. The four species considered in the analysis are: Anthus spinoletta, Crex crex, Picoides tridactylus, Glaucidium passerinum.

Because of some topological errors in the contours file, it had to be exported and repaired manually. The already preprocessed repaired contours enter the code in the 5th cell of the notebook. 
The original contours file was compressed to zip and its extent was reduced due to GitHub's file size constraints.
